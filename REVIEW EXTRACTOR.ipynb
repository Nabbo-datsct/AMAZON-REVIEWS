I spent most of the film looking at my cell phone to see what time it was and how much longer the movie could possibly go on. The main character is exceptionally infuriating. She's exquisite to watch on screen but you don't care two smidgens about her. All of the male characters are pathetic and womanizers. The costumes and the sets are beautiful, as is the cinematography.If the movie were shorter and had more character development it would be worth watching. Skip this one.

Wayne is a superb lyricist, drawing on everything from Arthurian mythology to important social issues, as in the child abuse song, Amelia.Just scanning the Amazon readers' reviews gives you some sense of the quality of this album.

It is a real show stopper. All the duets preceding it were quite good too with the kids working out their personal relationships around the duets.

For sure, the things that Camisa de Venus (the Brazilian word for condom) sing about are as risque as could be aired on the radio in the mid-1980s (rape, kidnap, murder, domestic violence, cheating etc.), but with a mild rockabilly style more typical of Raul Seixas-era Brazilian rock, Camisa de Venus fails to rock.

Stoessinger dismisses economics as a motivating factor in human conflict entirely. Instead, he insists that the cause of war is misunderstanding. This simplistic view also insults the memory of anyone who has fought for any belief, whether that belief is justified by history or not.

Things pick up a bit around page 145 as if DeMille had had a shot of adrenaline (or Scotch) while his hero plays detective. His hero by the way has few redeeming qualities, with a not so witty smug remark for everything. Then the author runs out of steam again and by 250 pages or so, brings in the formulaic.Just skip to the end of the book to the they-lived-happily-ever-after-saving-the-universe conclusion.If there is one thing DeMille achieves in this novel, it is not thrills, not excitement, not derring-do, but pure, supreme emphathy for the long-suffering wife/heroine. And that is no justification for reading a non-thrilling thriller. You will, however, read a lot about bears. Bears, bears, bears--which the hero never encounters but seemingly fears, a literary device which the author uses to justify his impossible ending.\\n',\n",

However, the author appears to treat everyone fairly and criticizes politicians on both sides of the isle.

At least two of the subplots are tedious enough that I ultimately just started skimming over those sections or skipping them entirely.

I only used this unit for half an hour before I realized that I made a mistake for buying it. On the box it specifically says that it can handle small twigs and pine cones. Well, a small twig smaller than the size of a drinking straw got caught in the nozzle, while rubbing against the *plastic* chopping blade. The friction caused the plastic blade to melt, and the twig started smoking. When I stopped the unit and opened it up, I found a groove cut into the chopping blade. Let's say that the little twig won this battle. The unit's performance was significantly reduced at this point. They should have used a more durable metallic chopper. Also the pine cones were not getting chopped, but were simply bouncing off the chopper blade endlessly, further wearing it down.\\n\",\n",

Near the beginning of the book, his advice for the reader having trouble with the project is something like \"wave a dead chicken over it\". Could be funny, unless you\\'re desperately trying to figure out what went wrong. There are many typos in the book (though I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever read a programming book that didn\\'t have at least one). The use of poor quality black-and-white photos also doesn\\'t help, especially if the color of a wire is important.I think most readers will learn something from this book, but it is still a poor investment and not the best choice for those trying to learn microcontroller programming.

This is not a book about how wonderfull Christmas is but how sick and screwed up the world is with Christmas as the backdrop.

The little vignettes within the story about the going ons in the Santa department is truly funny because it is true. I worked at a famous toy chain one year and the same stories happened to me. Not one of the stories is traditional, but written with a New York sense of humor. \"Front Row Center With Thaddeus Bristol\" is about a serious review of children\\'s Cristmas pagents and is every bit as blistering as if they were a Broadway play. \"Christmas Means Giving\" is about one-up-man-ship of trying to keep up with the Joneses and is every bit as funny as it is sick.

The content was really strange and seemed not to make any sense. I got the impression that the author is a very confused individual lacking in social skills and life experience. Some of the poems took on a sexual nature. The way in which these poems were written led me to the conclusion that Kim has never had a girlfriend because he seemed clueless when it came to analysing female behaviour and their relationships with men.A few of the poems presented racist and anti-Semitic ideas, which could cause offence to ethnic minorities and Jews. These poems were pretty awful in most aspects and should be avoided as a result.\\n',\n",

Viewers with a prior knowledge of Arenas' life and work will derive more from the episodic narrative than most casual viewers, though no one could fail to be impressed by Javier Bardem's Oscar-nominated performance in the central role. Strong supporting cast, too, including Johnny Depp in brief - but memorable - dual roles, Olivier Martinez (as Arenas' closest friend) and a virtually unrecognizable Santiago Magill (DON'T TELL ANYONE) as one of Bardem's early sexual conquests.

It explores the different faiths and how some of the beliefs formulated centuries ago are no longer relevant to the modern ways of viewing the world. ie. virgin births.

One is plain yet sweet, the other is beautiful yet dark (picture an evil Asian Uma Thurman). The drama depicts the struggles that each girl faces as they try to achieve there dreams. One will risk everything to get what she wants, the other achieves hers through her dedication and strong moral ethics. This drama has everything you could want from a K-drama; love, betrayal, comedy and tears. The acting is outstanding and it moves at a fast enough pace that you won't get bored. Buy it because it is definitely one you will re-watch. Han-Jae-Suk is incredible and plays such a different role than he did in Glass Slipper. The real show stealer though is Jang Dong Gun who could not be sexier if he tried. Fantastic, don't miss it!\\n\",\n",

For example double word bonus squares are too close together so that one word can easily cover two of them. There are too many qualdruples scores leading to scores of over 700 for each player. The main drawback is that with 200 tiles it takes more than 3 hours to complete a game so we end up setting an end time which loses some of the challenges of using up all of the letters.

They did include a slide extention thing. But the slide extention thing is just a piece of plastic and is useless. So basically this \"Automatic\" thing is useless for the most part. If you are hitting the ball and goes into the \"gutter\" behind the hole, it stills goes down the tiny slide.This item is good if you are going to take a few shots.

Radiohead really sets themselves apart from the rest; their willingness to experiment with new sounds and making it WORK deserves them much admiration and respect.

There's plenty of background information on the key players and the entire book is quite riveting. My only complaint is that Hibbert didn't go far enough in attempting to explain motivations for the convoluted shifting of alliances and all the political in-fighting that took place.

A few infected humans are transformed in zombies, controlled by their alien and evil intelligence. The nanoparticles also reassemble and rearrange themselves at will, to mimic with perfection any human being they choose to. They evolve so fast, so well, that a makeshift biochemical process is worked out to synthetize brand new nanoparticles, expanding the swarms (animals and a few unlucky humans, purposedly hunted and killed by the swarms, are the raw material).

I would have like to seen the dictionary to have more content, and I personally think that instead of jumping right in the middle of Gaelic conversation, the book should have given a little more basic short word phrases and need to know info like, numbers, greetings, time, names, etc. Overall I think it was a very informative work, and if you consentrate on the language hard enough, this book will give you a good working conversational grasp of the language.\\n\",\n",

Too much mid projection and your guitar tone turns to an AM radio, and too much bottom turns your arpegiated chords and sweep picked notes into conjested mush. The V6s shine at accurate reproduction of notes and clarity of tone.As a semi- nit pickey home audiophile, I wanted a phone that again was accurate and projected a nice acoustic balance over all freqs.

For instance, \"Would You Let Me\" gives the listener one side of a marital spat that goes absolutely nowhere. Roy\\'s delivery is dead on perfect as a husband who can\\'t even finish anything he starts to say to his wife. I recommend strongly that you listen to this with someone you love.I\\'ve seen Roy Zimmerman in concert twice, and these CDs catch some of the energy of his live performances (most of the tracks are recorded live).

The last fight sequence was 10 minutes of 20 men shooting at them with face to face semi-auto rapid fire, but Brangelina ducked, somersaulted, & spun effortlessly away from every bullet to sashay away into the sunset. It was so ridiculous what measured enjoyment I had from the beginning of the film was completely lost. A weak plot and a slightly disturbing view of marriage all add up to a so-so rental.

Ordered them in August, they arrived quickly, but each or the 6 containers says \"Sell by 07/06/11\", so they are out of date. Still, sell by is not the same as use by, and all of that dating business is not required or regulated and doesn\\'t mean that much. So I tried them. The first container was pretty tasty and the cashews were HUGE. Then a couple of the others had issues with the plastic \"seal\" underneath the snap-on lid. So I won\\'t be buying these again, since the ones I could use ended up being as expensive as the ones I can get at the local store. It is a shame, as the nuts are very tasty when they go into the package. They just don\\'t stay that way, and you may get tnuts that are past the sell-by date to begin with.\\n',\n",

There is nothing inherent in music creation that helped the human species survive the ravages of hunger, disease, pestilence, and war. There was no \"battle of the bands\" being waged on the prehistoric Serengeti plain to demonstrate defiance of environmental pressures to adapt.

I found the magic system of \"endowments\" to be interesting, but ultimately underdeveloped, especially the obvious moral aspects involved. The writer\\'s style was very annoying in that he continuously broke the cardinal rule of fiction writing: show, don\\'t tell. I don\\'t want to be told what such and such a character feels, I want to see it and experience it along with them. This style left the characters flat and lifeless. While the author made a few attempts at world-building, his efforts didn\\'t amount to much more than namedropping. It\\'s really too bad, because this could have been a major work of fantasy fiction, given one or two more re-writes and a decent editor.

The chapters also set up the plot quickly, with wife of CIA operations chief Carrie McNeil being interviewed after her husband Drum has disappeared.This novel runs at 370 pages yet the action could have been boiled down to about 100. Nothing really happens. Smith does a good job establishing the few characters there are in this novel, perhaps too good. Many pages ramble on and on about day to day activities of Carrie and her son Jonah and their life. Sure, the ending has some action and few \"twists\". But absolutely nothing happens before that.

Throughout the book, one only reads of the politeness of the Japanese. I doubt the countless women of Korea, China and the Philippines raped and kept as \"comfort women\" during Japanese occupation would agree with that assessment. No mention is given to the various cultural treasures Japan looted from her Asian neighbors.In Chapter 3, the author uses the word \"cripple\".

Two months later it leaks like crazy during the brew cycle. Of course in order to get warranty service it will cost you another $10, plus the s/h, yeah right. My list of junk coffee makers has another addition, Cusinart. I fully expected this brand to be well made and now my opinion is quite different.

I don't know much about espresso machinces but I do have a few complaints about this one.1) The coffee doesn't always come out consistantly dark. Usually the coffee comes out black for the first 2 oz (1 oz per cup) then the additional 2 oz (1 oz per cup) is a lot more clear. I have used other machines that seem to extract more coffee flavor from the grinds.2) After removing the plastic frothing peice for cleaning, when putting it back on, you must be careful not to strip the threads.3) The area for the espresso cups isn't very tall, you either have to put cups in at an angle for them to fit under the espresso spout, or you have to use shorter, shot glass like cups (or true espresso cups) for them to fit.Some things that i like about this machine.1) Easy to use2) Fast warm up time3) Easy to clean4) The frother frothes really well.5) Very good machine for the price. I paid $100.\\n\",\n",

Unless you hold down the sleeve that fits over the gears they grind and begin to smoke. The push button controls are awkward to use and it's easy to overprocess foods. The blender works better than the processor but still has a tendency to loosen from the base if you don't constantly hold the thing together. After 2 weeks I'm already shopping for a new machine. I wouldn't recommend this machine to even the casual user. Smoking appliances have no place in any kitchen.\\n\",\n",

In this movie \"Gandhi\"; Mr. Jinnah has been incorrectly protrayed as an irresponsible; shabbily attired confused leader.

Often, Picoult writes with a hint of magic, but this book is just bleak and the characters are much less sympathetic than in her other books. It also leaves the ending rather unfinished. The \"twist\" to the plot is just... lame and while it doesn\\'t follow her courtroom formula, the book still has a formulaic feel.The comic book sections were entertaining enough, but the game with the hidden letters was more distracting than enriching.

Vasseur writes each character with a parental attitude that he loves them in spite of their flaws and that he loves them because of their virtues. He can mine those virtues well.

It focuses very much on relationships, family, power and privilage. The FT&T universe is fun, even if improbable at this point in time (and I mean imprabable in the sci-fi sense - that is, mind power is not within the \\'probable\\' spectrum that serious sci-fi writers pick from).

On that basis, I recommend reading the poem You, referred to by one reviewer as a trite generalization directed at a distant you. Doesn't feel trite or generalized to me--in fact, as it transports me into the experience of someone yearning for his dead mother (pretty specific, huh?) it makes me cry.

There's a lot of things that bothered me about this book, many of which were already mentioned, so I will try not to repeat them. See the 1 star rating reviews!

Despite the title, it offered no help for the undisciplined. The only thing good about it is that it is nice and short and requires very little reading comprehension. So, even if you are so undisciplined, you can still finish it:) What exactly is this book about? It is a poorly written autobiography. Mr Kern said that it is ok to have an ego, as long as you don't let anyone know about it. THEN HE WRITES A BOOK LIKE THIS!

seriously, this game already required a labotomy to play because the controls, gameplay and graphics were bad in the arcade. now it's even worse on the home system because now you still need that labotomy, a root canal and an eye appointment when they put the blue thing in your eye to play this game!war gods is totally unoriginal. it's a total rip of mk and ki combined with the hope of some tekken and virtua fighter. the controls, like i said, were awful. nothing in this world could help you get used to the poorly thought out controls. and second, the game just isn't fun. it's just not and it's very difficult getting into this game because of all the bad perks about it.if i could give this game a zero i would. seriously avoid this one. granted yes there weren't as many fighting games on the 64 but i'm sure you could find one that was better than this piece of trash.\", \"psp vs. ds, one of the most telling answers lies in...: the number of stars of the average customer review between them! more of the people find themselves happy with the ds even though many people knew the psp was coming! isn't it usually when you first get something that you're most excited about it. ds' rating has stood the test of time and it's still higher than psp. plus this is after months of very little games for ds. ds is gonna to get excellent games in the future far better than what's being announced for psp.\", \"contra: shattered soldier: i was somewhat disappointed when i bought this game. after hearing that this was one of the more difficult games for ps2, i expected a very fast, exciting, and well developed game. contra is not that kind of game. if i wanted a 2d game, i could have gotten a snes game. the only movements you can make are forward, back, jump, crouch. what a waste of ps2's graphic power. the gameplay is anything but entertaining. basically, you play the mission until you come to something you have never seen before. it kills you. you restart the mission and kill it. this cycle goes on for the rest of the mission.\", 'never buy this mature game.: this is the sickest game for playstation2.keep this game away from the kids.on this game you can kill people for money,do drive by shooting,kill people in fights,murder the police,blow up cars,gang shoot when you drive by there area.this a game for adult.']\n"
